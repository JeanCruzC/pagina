"""Utility functions for simple time series smoothing and forecasting.

This module exposes a :func:`timeseries_core` helper used by the web
application to generate a smoothed series and a naive forecast.  The function
returns a Plotly ``Figure`` alongside some basic metrics which are displayed in
the UI.

The implementation intentionally keeps the logic lightweight â€“ it does not aim
to be a full fledged forecasting library but rather a demonstrative example
that produces deterministic results for testing purposes.
